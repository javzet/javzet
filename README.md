### 👋 Hi, I'm Javier Zetina, react developer.

- I'm a student, I have 17 years old and I´m Mexican of course.

I started to programing 3 years ago, yep, I know this github profile don´t seems 
like a person who's been programming for three years but recently I started to create better projects than previous one
and also I used to save them on a USB drive.
